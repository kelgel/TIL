# 2025-06-18 Adding Search Functionality to the Board

## What I did today
- Briefly studied how to add a search feature to the message board in Spring

## What I learned
- Implemented basic search functionality using Spring MVC and MyBatis
- Learned how to pass search keywords from the view to the controller, and filter results in SQL queries
- Realized that search greatly improves user experience by allowing users to quickly find relevant posts

## Goals for tomorrow
- Refine the search feature to support multiple conditions (e.g., title, content, writer)
- Add pagination to the search results
