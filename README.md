# 🌱 TIL (Today I Learned)

Welcome to my TIL (Today I Learned) repository!  
Here, I document something new I learn every day as I grow into a professional backend developer.    
The goal is to make consistent progress and build up a habit of lifelong learning.

## 📚 About

This repository is a curated collection of my daily learning notes, code snippets, troubleshooting logs, and technical reflections.  
My main goal is to build a strong, consistent learning habit while advancing my backend engineering skills—especially in Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and scalable architectures suitable for enterprise environments.
