# 2024-06-09 DB Modeling & Screen Specification

## What I did today
- Created a screen specification for a shopping mall project
- Read one chapter of a database modeling book
- Studied and programmed the paging section

## What I learned

- How to create a screen specification, including rules and detailed screen definitions  
    - *Why it matters: Well-defined screen specifications improve communication among developers and ensure that everyone shares the same vision for the UI and workflow.*

- The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model represents real-world processes through two core concepts: Entity and Relationship  
    - *Lesson learned: Understanding ER models is fundamental for translating business requirements into an efficient and maintainable database design.*

- Key characteristics of the ER Model include completeness, correctness, minimality, self-explanation, and extensibility  
    - *Why it matters: Keeping these principles in mind ensures that the database model is robust, easy to understand, and adaptable to future changes.*

## Goals for tomorrow
- Plan and outline the screen structure to use as a basis for logical modeling
- Read another chapter of the database modeling book
