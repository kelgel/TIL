# 2025-06-26 QnA Board Final Review & Presentation

## What I Did Today

- Wrapped up the team project and gave the final presentation  
- Listened to other teamsâ€™ presentations and reflected on areas for improvement  
- Studied Git commands that I found confusing during the project

## What I Learned

### Final Reflections After Completing the first Toy Project

#### ðŸ§© Team Reflection  
As a team, we realized there were duplicated components and inconsistent structures due to a lack of discussion about shared code elements such as controllers or variable names.  
(While modeling ERD, we communicated a lot because all the parts were connected, but after the programming, the frequency of communication has decreased.)
We concluded that for future projects:
- It's essential to **establish basic rules** and **common naming conventions** early.
- Better **communication** is required, especially when dealing with shared logic or templates.
- While we followed basic collaboration rules, we didnâ€™t keep track of key decisions or issues in writing, which caused confusion later.
  

#### ðŸ‘¤ Personal Reflection  
I focused on getting the basic functionality working first, but there are many areas I now want to improveâ€”such as refactoring the code and adding features like soft deletes, private posts, and better front-end styling.

 ðŸ”„ **Keep (What to Continue):**
- Arriving one hour early every day to start work
- Logging daily progress and learnings

 ðŸ”„ **Problem (What Didnâ€™t Go Well):**
- I still lack a strong grasp of certain areas, leading to confusion and time inefficiencies
- My limited front-end skills meant I relied on AI for layout and design
- I depended heavily on teammates due to unfamiliarity with Git commands
- While I could implement basic features from Spring lectures, I didnâ€™t fully utilize or customize them

 ðŸ”„ **Try (What Iâ€™ll Do Next Time):**
- Strengthen understanding of core concepts and theory  
- Study front-end basics and try building my own UI components  
- Learn Git command-line usage and project structure better to work more independently  
- Challenge myself to write and troubleshoot code without depending too much on AI or tutorials  
- Build consistent personal habitsâ€”like regular exercise to stay energized

*ðŸ’¡ I was especially inspired by one team that clearly defined all rules, templates, and collaboration methods *before* development began. Their strong communication and planning made the development process much smoother. This reinforced how valuable it is to plan thoroughly and align the team early on.*

## Goals for Tomorrow

- Start a Spring Boot course  
- Set up the development environment for my next individual project
