# 2025-06-29 Final Retrospective of the Toy Project

## What I Did Today
- Instead of studying a new topic, I took time to write a **final retrospective** of our 3rd team toy project.
- Summarized what went well, what could be improved, and what I learned through this project experience.
- Shared insights and personal reflections in a blog post.

- Writing a structured retrospective helped me organize my thoughts and track my growth as a developer.
