# 2025-06-30 Basic Python and Building Login Page & Layout Structure in Spring Boot

## What I Did Today

- Started a Spring Boot practice project - Built a basic login page 
- Used Thymeleaf layout fragments to manage page templates and content injection
- Designed basic UI structure with css (navigation bar, footer, hover effects)
- Practiced core python programming tasks on data types using a Jupyter Notebook

---

## What I Learned

- ### HTML + Thymeleaf Integration
  - Learned how to structure an HTML layout using `header` and `footer` fragments, and inject dynamic content using `layout:fragment`.
  - Understood how to apply a common layout to multiple pages using `layout:decorate`, which greatly improves maintainability and consistency across views.

- ### CSS Styling Basics
  - Applied simple styles like `inline-block` navigation, hover effects, and reset rules using `main.css`.
  - Realized how small changes in padding, color, and structure can improve the UI even at a basic level.

- ### Login Form Implementation
  - Built a login form with inputs for `id` and `pwd`, submitted via POST to a backend controller.
  - Saw how form data is passed to the server and how Thymeleaf can render server-side messages using `${param.msg}`.

- ### Python Practice
  - Studied core Python data types and variables through hands-on exercises using Jupyter Notebook.
  - Practiced defining and printing variables, understanding types like `int`, `double`, `boolean`, and `String`.

## Goals for Tomorrow

- Connect login form to backend logic and validate user input using Spring MVC   
- Enhance front-end design with better alignment and responsive layout
- Study and practice Python core functions
