# 2025-07-07 TIL â€” Java Review & Spring Boot Book CRUD Implementation

## What I Did Today
- Reviewed Java Chapter 1: Overview of JVM, JDK, JRE, and Java execution model.
- Started implementing a basic Book List CRUD feature for the admin panel using Spring Boot + Thymeleaf.
- Compared traditional Spring (with MyBatis) and Spring Boot (with JPA) query methods.

##  What I Learned
- ### â˜• Java Recap: Platform Independence
  Java achieves OS-independence using the JVM.
  Source .java â†’ compiled into .class (bytecode) â†’ runs on JVM â†’ platform-independent.

Key components:
| Component | Description                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JDK**   | Java Development Kit - tools for writing & compiling code |
| **JRE**   | Java Runtime Environment - required to run Java apps      |
| **JVM**   | Java Virtual Machine - runs bytecode on each platform     |

*ðŸ”‘ Key phrase: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" â€“ made possible by JVM abstraction.*   

- ### ðŸŒ± Spring Boot: Admin Book CRUD (List)
  Implemented the admin-side book list feature using:
    @Entity, @Repository, @Service, @Controller, Thymeleaf templates for rendering the list
  Spring Bootâ€™s JPA query abstraction felt different from MyBatis: Auto-generates queries based on method names
  -> Configuration is simpler, but less explicit (less SQL control)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection
  Reviewing Java reminded me how JVM architecture allows for cross-platform compatibility.
  In Spring Boot, I appreciated how Entity-Repository-Service-Controller works as a clean pipeline, though query abstraction needs deeper understanding.
  Since Iâ€™ve mostly worked in Python recently, I felt a bit rusty with Java class syntax and structure, so regular review is necessary.

---

## Goals for Tomorrow
- Study @Query, sorting, and filtering in JPA.
- Continue reviewing Java Chapter 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators.
