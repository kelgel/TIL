## What I Learned Today
- ### ‚òï Java Conditionals & Loops (Chapter 4)
üîπ Conditional Statements
    if: Allows complex logical conditions and ranges

üîπswitch: Simpler for fixed values like int, char, String
    ‚Üí Be careful: without break, fall-through occurs

üîπ Loop Statements

  | Statement  | Checks condition first | Executes at least once |
  | ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `while`    | ‚úÖ                      | ‚ùå                      |
  | `do-while` | ‚ùå                      | ‚úÖ                      |

(+) Tips
- if vs switch: Use if for range conditions, switch for fixed values
- do-while: Use when at least one execution is required
- Be careful where you initialize variables in loops

## Goals for Tomorrow
- Add pagination and sorting to the book list page
- Review Java Chapter 5 (Arrays)
