# 2025-07-15 TIL Basic Term for Project

## What I did today
- Finalized the goal and direction for our team project: a LangChain-based Chatbot System.
- Studied and organized key terminologies essential for understanding LangChain architecture and AI application development.

---

 ## What I learned
 - ### ðŸ§© Key Terminologies and Concepts
- LangChain : A Python-based framework that simplifies the development of LLM-powered applications
- Framework : A reusable software skeleton that provides common functionalities to accelerate development
- Prompt : An input instruction for LLMs that determines their output quality
- Template : A dynamic structure used to generate prompts with variable substitutions
- Agent : A decision-making component that can autonomoulsy invoke tools based on goals
- Tool : A set of functions or capabilites that an agent can access to solve tasks
- LLM (Large Language Model) : An AI model trained on massive text datasets capable of generating and understanding language
- API (Application Programming Interface) : An interface that allows communication between systems
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generated) : A method to reduce hallucinations by combining information retrieval with generation
  Docker : A Containerization technology that packages applications with their environment, ensuring consistency across systems

## Reflections
- LangChainâ€™s architecture can be overwhelming, but breaking it down into terms like Prompt, Agent, Tool, and RAG really helped.
---

## Goals for Tomorrow
- Start prototyping document loading and text splitting in LangChain.
- Research possible tools (APIs, calculators, search tools) to integrate via the agent
- Study Java (Chapter 7) for tomorrowâ€™s review session.
