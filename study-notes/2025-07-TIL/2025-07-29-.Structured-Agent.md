# 2025-07-29 TIL â€“ From Unified Agent to Modular Tool Design

## What I Did Today
- Refactoring the recommendation agent by splitting tools based on recommendation type: emotion, genre, author, etc.
- Applied args_schema using Pydantic to enforce input structure and guide LLM inference more reliably.

---

## What I Learned
- Different recommendation criteria require different similarity search strategies (emotion embedding, genre embedding, sentence similarity, etc.).

  Splitting tools helps in:
  - Clarifying the purpose and search logic for each case
  - Making the system easier to maintain and extend
  - Improving accuracy when selecting and invoking tools via the agent

- args_schema is crucial for helping the LLM understand what inputs to extract and how to call the tool, reducing the chance of misuse or invalid calls.

---

## Reflection
- Still on the refactoring process, but there were some limitations and errors while doing it.
- Noticed the importance  of the communication between teammates.

---

## Goals for Tomorrow
- Finalize combined-condition recommendation tool using multi-key embeddings (e.g., emotion + genre + keywords).
- Implement custom error handling for missing or invalid tool inputs (e.g., emotion not provided).
- Start integrating Tool-based routing logic into the main agent, replacing prompt-only logic.
