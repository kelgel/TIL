# 2025-09-03 TIL: Practicing SQL Query - Basic Select

## What I Did Today

- Solved several SQL practice problems using the STATION and CITY tables.
- Practiced writing queries involving filtering, sorting, distinct values, string length functions, and combining results.
- Explored different SQL clauses such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and UNION.

---

## What I Learned

- How to use DISTINCT to remove duplicate values efficiently.
- The difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(DISTINCT col).
- Using LENGTH() (or CHAR_LENGTH()) to calculate string lengths.
- Applying multi-level sorting with ORDER BY length ASC/DESC, CITY ASC.
- Using LIMIT and OFFSET to control the number of rows returned.

## Reflections

- Understanding the execution flow of SQL (FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY) makes solving problems much easier.
- Writing queries step by step, starting from simple SELECT statements and gradually adding conditions, helped avoid confusion.

---

## Goals for Tomorrow

- Solve more SQL problems focusing on aggregation and subqueries.
- Practice advanced string and date functions in SQL.
- Create a personal summary sheet for commonly used SQL functions and clauses.
