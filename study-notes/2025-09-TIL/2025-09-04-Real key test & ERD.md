# 2025-09-04 TIL- Real key test & ERD

## what i did today

- Updated the ERD and on the process of setting up Oracle-ready tables.
- Got a real API key, wired it to FastAPI (LangChain), and ran smoke tests.
= Tweaked my resume to include the LLM work.

---

## what i learned

= Postman Web needs Desktop Agent (or use /dry-run / Newman) for local files.
- Pre-validating evidence with source_url cuts failures.
= A fixed JSON schema keeps integrations clean.

---

## Reflections

Good logs make troubleshooting and reporting fast.

---

## Goals for tomorrow

- Run /dry-run?n=50&seed=42 and record p50/p95/success rate.
- Save results to Oracle from Spring after the FastAPI call.
