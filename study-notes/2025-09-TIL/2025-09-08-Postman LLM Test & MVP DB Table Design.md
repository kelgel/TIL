# 2025-09-08  TIL-Postman LLM Test & MVP DB Table Design

## What I Did Today

- Tested LLM API calls using Postman to verify if only providing the title and URL returns the expected result.
- Worked on database table design for the MVP version. Explored whether to keep a single table for simplicity or separate tables for requests, responses, and version control.

---

## What I Learned

- Gained insights into structuring database tables efficiently for MVPs versus scalable architectures.
- Understood the trade-offs between simple table designs and modular designs with separate entities.

---
  
## Reflections

I realized I need to balance between development speed and future scalability.
Itâ€™s important to define clear priorities for the MVP and avoid overengineering at this stage.

---

##  Goals for Tomorrow

- Finalize the database schema and ERD for the MVP.
- Implement initial LLM integration with the designed tables.
- Prepare sample data for testing the content generation flow.
